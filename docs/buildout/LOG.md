# Session Log

_Append-only. Newest entries at the top. One block per loop iteration: date, what
shipped, what surprised you, what's next. This is the narrative memory that the
COVERAGE ledger and QUEUE don't capture._

## 2026-07-05 — Bootstrap (branch `buildout-infra`)

**Shipped — the build-out infrastructure (Phase 0), no machines built:**

- `docs/buildout/` memo system: NORTH_STAR, COVERAGE (56-row matrix), QUEUE
  (phased), VISUAL_VOCAB, this LOG, HANDOFF, README.
- `app/tools/coverageCheck.ts` — the adversarial harness. Self-test reuses the
  existing devData sample machines and **discriminates correct vs. broken across
  all five modes today**. Ledger reads `coverage-manifest.json` (56 rows, all
  pending) and reports verified/pending/regressed + a JSON summary.
- `app/tools/fixtures/coverage-manifest.json` (full HW1–6 set) +
  `fixtures/reference/README.md` (fixture format).
- `npm run coverage` and `npm run check` scripts in `app/package.json`.
- `.claude/commands/handoff.md` — the per-iteration loop procedure; run
  `/loop /handoff` in a separate Ultracode session to drive it.

**Verified:** `npm run coverage` → self-test 10/10 PASS, `COVERAGE OK` (exit 0),
0/56 verified · 56 pending. `npm install` reconciled node_modules to the existing
lockfile (tsx was missing after the pull) — no lockfile change.

**Surprises / reframing:** the pulled codebase is *far* more built out than the
kickoff described — all five modes exist end-to-end per CLAUDE.md. Reading the real
homeworks fixed the true scope: 56 machine-buildable problems, and the genuine
gaps are (1) perception isn't authorable in the current DSL, (2) FSM-turbots can't
turn (1-bit motor), (3) navigation generality needs multi-arena grading, (4) the TM
two-output visual change. These are queued as Phases 2–5, not "build from scratch."

**Next:** run `/loop /handoff` in a fresh session. First real task is **P0.4** —
author + build the **hw1-p1 NAND** reference fixture end-to-end (build in the app,
export `CircuitData`, add a broken variant, wire it into the manifest) to prove the
fixture path and turn the first COVERAGE row green.

_Infra is on branch `buildout-infra` (not pushed). Human will decide when to merge._
